# Customer-Churn-Analyzer
This project uses classification models to detect churn risk based on features. It supports proactive customer retention  strategies.

### Dataset Description

The project uses the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** with 7,043 records and 33 features.  
It includes customer details (e.g. contract type, charges) and churn-related columns like `Churn Value`, and `Churn Reason`.  
The dataset is used for **EDA** and **model training** to predict customer churn and understand key factors influencing it.
